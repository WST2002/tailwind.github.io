                  With it, the sweet smells of sugary summer pour out. Just a few feet away, our world-class bake staff is hard at work frying, proofing and glazing treats for the following day. People from all walks of life line up by the hundreds looking to satisfy their sweet tooth.
                  
                  Don’t be shy - step in line and strike up a conversation with the group next to you. Take in another beautiful evening on the Vineyard and mull over your options.
                  
                  Indulgence is just a few steps away!
